# Molecular_Weight_Calculator (MW_Calc)
In this project (written in Fortran) one can easily calculate the molcular weight (in amu unit) of a given molecular structure by user. Keeping the files (*.f90 and *.txt) in the same folder the calculations can be achived through terminal, just typing the command:
```sh
gfortran -o mol mol_wigt.f90
```
 where "mol" will be generated as executable file and for run the executable file:
 ```sh
./mol
```
One can use a simple command:
```sh
gfortran mol_wigt.f90
```
where a.out will be generated as default executable file and then follow the same process:
```sh
./a.out
```
So, play with your molecule, hope you will enjoy! \
Though, it has some limitations but trying to resolve that issues and update asap in the version 2.O.
