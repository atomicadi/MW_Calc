# Molecular_Weight_Calculator
In this project (written in Fortran) one can easily calculate the molcular weight of a molecular structre. By keeping the files (*.f90 and *.txt) in the same folder the calculations can be achived through terminal just typing the Fortran code run command (gfortran -o xyz *.f90 -> ./xyz) OR (gfortran *.f90 -> ./a.out). So, Play with your molecule, hope you will enjoy!
Though, it has some limitations. Trying to resolve that issues and update soon in the version 2.O
