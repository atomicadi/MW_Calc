# Molecular_Weight_Calculator (MW_Calc)
In this project (written in Fortran) one can easily calculate the molcular weight (in amu unit) of a given molecular structure by user. By keeping the files (*.f90 and *.txt) in the same folder the calculations can be achived through terminal just typing the Fortran code run command (gfortran -o xyz *.f90 -> ./xyz) OR (gfortran *.f90 -> ./a.out) {In the first command "XYZ" file will be generated as executable file whereas for the second one, it will generat a.out as executable}. So, Play with your molecule, hope you will enjoy!
Though, it has some limitations. Trying to resolve that issues and update soon in the version 2.O
